## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- media query

### What I learned

I learned lot of things about CSS like, sizing, turning a div into a circle, media query ect 


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on using flexbox in a more efficient manner to get the best resuts. And more importantly on Javascript to build a responsive website.

### Useful resources
